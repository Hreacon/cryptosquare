1. Spacing and indenting is all correct, correct files are included, readme not filled out but template is included. Nice!
2. Your variable naming is not always clear or easy to follow
3. As to the ease of following your code, I would HIGHLY suggest inserting short comments describing what you are trying to do.
4. Your specs are very brief, encompass several steps, and have poor discriptors. I would break down your steps further to catch problems you may miss, for example you are not setting the right size for you cryptosquares (only rounds up to the right size if Math.round() rounds up, but it can round down too).

Overall, I'm impressed with your coding and problem solving. Not an easy assignment. Nicely done.
